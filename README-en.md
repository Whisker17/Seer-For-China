## Seer Program

### Abstract

Joining the Seer program provides a unique opportunity to work with other like-minded people, provide access to resources and materials to help you create or develop, and provide you with a channel of communication with Zeitgeist team members. A number of events and initiatives will be held throughout the plan, all of which are aimed at developing the Zeitgeist ecosystem. Those who prove themselves to be active contributors to the ecosystem will stand out among their peers by earning the title.

### Benefits

- We are developing an economic system called ["Discord Kudocoin currency system"](https://zeitgeist-seer.com/events). The system will be an important part of the whole Seer program and promote our whole project. Kudocoin will be the currency of the economic system and will be available only to specially selected project participants and ambassadors with Title Level 3.

- Have the opportunity to get various **rewards** given by the team, and [**extra points**]() in content creations

## Accumulating Points

### Abstract

As a unique campaign of Zeitgeist Chinese community, in order to motivate everyone to contribute more to the community and ecology, we set up a competition called “Accumulating Points” . Everyone's points can be viewed in the ranking table. Check this form to get how to earn points.

### Rules

- Maximum 1000 points per person a month (except the points obtained from the official reward task)
- All participants need to maintain their own database. See this article for details: https://github.com/Whisker17/Seer-For-China/blob/main/db/How-To-Build.md 
- If the task is completed in cooperation, you need to allocate the proportion yourself in advance and specify it in the issue
- Becoming an ambassador will have a certain point bonus. With your points accumulate, you can get a higher bonus. See the ambassador's extra bonus table for details.
- The monthly prize pool will increase dynamically with the increase of the number of participants, initially 1000 ZTG. These ZTGS are distributed in proportion to their points each month
