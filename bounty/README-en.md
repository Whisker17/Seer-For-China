## Official Reward Task

The Chinese community team will also issue reward tasks. These rewards will **not** be included in the monthly point limit. See this [table](https://github.com/Whisker17/Seer-For-China/blob/main/bounty/official/lists.md ) for the list of official reward tasks.

**All official reward tasks are supervised by everyone. Anyone can raise an objection if he think the task is not good enough, and the team will double check it to decide whether the reward should be reduced or even cancelled.**
