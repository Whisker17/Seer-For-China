# Community Autonomous WeChat Official Account

## Simple Summary

Establish a WeChat Official Account governed by the community

## Motivation

As the official WeChat Official Account is the official platform for Zeitgeist, the content is limited to official news, and we hope to accomplish the separation of official / community, and the community is fully self-governed by everyone, so we decided to establish an exclusive WeChat Official Account for each member of the community for daily community operations and promotion.

## Duration

This task will be a long-term task and will be distributed according to the monthly contribution.

## Task Content

1. Create a new WeChat Official Account
2. Daily maintenance and article publish(requires at least 5 articles per month)
3. Promote the project and increase the exposure of the project
4. A monthly report article is required to be sent every month, including various data changes in the WeChat Official Account, so that officials can understand the development of the community
